# Categorise-UCI-Digit-Tasks
This work is to build a machine learning system to categorise one of the UCI digit tasks.

This program has testing with Euclidean Distance and Multi-Layer Perceptron.

Two-Fold testing has been performed.

In Euclidean distance system reads test and train dataset, merge them into one large array and then split while two-fold testing.

In Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) there are two array, one has test and other has train data. Delta learning rule was used.
